# OpenCirql Roadmap

## Phase 1 — MVP (Now → 1–2 months)
- Landing page with hero + call button
- Infinite **Livecasts** & **Profiles** carousels
- “Create my space” CTA
- Open Pool Ledger (Stripe placeholder + Solana 1.8 SOL demo)

## Phase 2 — Growth
- Profile-based search engine (topics → people)
- Auth + lightweight profiles
- Weekly payout reporting (auto summaries)

## Phase 3 — Scale
- Public APIs for profiles, livecasts, and ledger
- Mobile-first refinements
- Optional crypto on-ramps (after non-crypto traction)
